**### Hotel booking**
**Content:**
**1. EDA**

The dataset contains data from two different hotels. One Resort hotel and one City hotel.

From the publication (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) it is clear to us that both hotels are located in Portugal (southern Europe) ("H1 at the resort region of Algarve and H2 at the city of Lisbon"). The distance between these two locations is ca. 280 km by car and both locations border on the north atlantic.

The data contains "bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017".
Note: For most questions only those booking were used that were not cancelled, to get actual guest numbers. As you will see, this is quite a big difference.

Topics covered and questions to answer from the data:

_

- [ ] Where do the guests come from?
- [ ] How much do guests pay for a room per night?
- [ ] How does the price per night vary over the year?
- [ ] Which are the most busy month?
- [ ] How long do people stay at the hotels?
- [ ] Bookings by market segment
- [ ] How many bookings were canceled?
- [ ] Which month have the highest number of cancellations?_


**2. Predicting cancellations**

It would be nice for the hotels to have a model to predict if a guest will actually come.
This can help a hotel to plan things like personal and food requirements.
Maybe some hotels also use such a model to offer more rooms than they have to make more money... who knows...

**3. Evaluate Feature importance**

Here it is determined that which features are most important to predict cancellations?
